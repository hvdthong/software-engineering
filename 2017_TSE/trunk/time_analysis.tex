%Table~\ref{tab:running_time} shows means and standard deviations of AML's running time for different projects. From the table, we note that AML has an average running time of 46.01 seconds. Among the four projects, AML can process Rhino bugs with the least average running time (i.e., 17.94 seconds), and AML needs the longest running time to process AspectJ bugs (i.e., 72.79 seconds). Compared to the other three projects, AspectJ is considerably larger. Therefore, it takes more time for AML to tune its component weights. Considering that a developer can spend hours and even days to fix a bug~\cite{KimW06}, AML running time of 20-80 seconds is reasonable.
