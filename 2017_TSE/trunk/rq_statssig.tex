%Table \ref{tab:result_top_N} shows the results of Wilcoxon signed-rank test of AML* and AML among Top N. ($*$) means that results of AML* and AML are significant. AML* and AML are statistically significant in terms of top 1 methods among AspectJ, Ant, and Rhino at significant level 0.05 of Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Moreover, we see that AML* and AML show significant results among all the four software projects in the top 1 methods. Among top 5 methods, only AML* and AML are only significant in project Rhino. In the top 10 methods, AML* and AML do not show any significant results in all software projects.

%Table \ref{tab:result_map} presents the Wilcoxon signed-rank test of AML* and AML in terms of MAP. Similar to top 1 methods, AML* and AML are significant in AspectJ, Ant and Rhino, however they are not significant in project Lucene. However, both methods are significant across four different software data.
