@article{Benjamini1995thecontrol,
	abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling
	the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults,
	and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple
	significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected
	proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate.
	This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are
	true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control
	of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired,
	there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type
	procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent
	test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power
	is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness
	of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

  abstract = {Statistical debugging aims to automate the process of isolating bugs
	by profiling several runs of the program and using statistical analysis
	to pinpoint the likely causes of failure. In this paper, we investigate
	the impact of using richer program profiles such as path profiles
	on the effectiveness of bug isolation. We describe a statistical
	debugging tool called Holmes that isolates bugs by finding paths
	that correlate with failure. We also present an adaptive version
	of Holmes that uses iterative, bug-directed profiling to lower execution
	time and space overheads. We evaluate Holmes using programs from
	the SIR benchmark suite and some large real world applications. Our
	results indicate that path profiles can help isolate bugs more precisely
	by providing more information about the context in which bugs occur.
	Moreover, bug-directed profiling can efficiently isolate bugs with
	low overheads, providing a scalable and accurate alternative to sparse
	random sampling.},

	according to their likelihood of being faulty. The key idea is to
	see which program statements exercised during a failing run use values
	that can be altered so that the execution instead produces correct
	output. Our approach is effective in locating statements that are
	either faulty or directly linked to a faulty statement. We present
	experimental results showing the effectiveness and efficiency of
	our approach. Our approach outperforms Tarantula which, to our knowledge,
	is the most effective prior approach for statement ranking based
	fault localization using the benchmark programs we studied.},

	avoids such speculation by instead enabling developers to select
	a question about program output from a set of why did and why didn't
	questions derived from the program's code and execution. The tool
	then finds one or more possible explanations for the output in question,
	using a combination of static and dynamic slicing, precise call graphs,
	and new algorithms for determining potential sources of values and
	explanations for why a line of code was not reached. Evaluations
	of the tool on one task showed that novice programmers with the Whyline
	were twice as fast as expert programmers without it. The tool has
	the potential to simplify debugging in many software development

  abstract = {Debugging refers to the laborious process of finding causes of program
	failures. Often, such failures are introduced when a program undergoes
	changes and evolves from a stable version to a new, modified version.
	In this paper, we propose an automated approach for debugging evolving
	programs. Given two programs (a reference, stable program and a new,
	modified program) and an input that fails on the modified program,
	our approach uses concrete as well as symbolic execution to synthesize
	new inputs that differ marginally from the failing input in their
	control flow behavior. A comparison of the execution traces of the
	failing input and the new inputs provides critical clues to the root-cause
	of the failure. A notable feature of our approach is that it handles
	hard-to-explain bugs like code missing errors by pointing to the
	relevant code in the reference program. We have implemented our approach
	in a tool called DARWIN. We have conducted experiments with several
	real-life case studies, including real-world web servers and the
	libPNG library for manipulating PNG images. Our experience from these
	experiments points to the efficacy of DARWIN in pinpointing bugs.
	Moreover, while localizing a given observable error, the new inputs
	synthesized by DARWIN can reveal other undiscovered errors. },

  abstract = {Program slicing is a general, widely-used, and accepted technique
	applicable to different software engineering tasks including debugging,
	whereas model-based diagnosis is an AI technique originally developed
	for finding faults in physical systems. During the last years it
	has been shown that model-based diagnosis can be used for software
	debugging. In this paper we discuss the relationship between debugging
	using a dependency-based model and program slicing. As a result we
	obtain that slices of a program in a fault situation are equivalent
	to conflicts in model-based debugging.},

  abstract = {We describe the extension of the well-known model-based diagnosis
	approach to the location of errors in imperative programs (exhibited
	on a subset of the Java language). The source program is automatically
	converted to a logical representation (called model). Given this
	model and a particular test case or set of test cases, a program-independent
	search algorithm determines a the minimal sets of statements whose
	incorrectness can explain incorrect outcomes when the program is
	executed on the test cases, and which can then be indicated to the
	developer by the system. We analyze example cases and discuss empirical
	results from a Java debugger implementation incorporating our approach.
	The use of AI techniques is more flexible than traditional debugging
	techniques such as algorithmic debugging and program slicing.},

  abstract = {Typically debugging begins when during a program execution a point
	is reached at which an obviously incorrect value is observed. A general
	and powerful approach to automated debugging can be based upon identifying
	modifications to the program state that will bring the execution
	to a successful conclusion. However, searching for arbitrary changes
	to the program state is difficult due to the extremely large search
	space. In this paper we demonstrate that by forcibly switching a
	predicate's outcome at runtime and altering the control flow, the
	program state can not only be inexpensively modified, but in addition
	it is often possible to bring the program execution to a successful
	completion (i.e., program produces the desired output). By examining
	the switched predicate, also called the critical predicate, the cause
	of the bug can then be identified. Since the outcome of a branch
	can only be either true or false, the number of modified states resulting
	by predicate switching is far less than those possible through arbitrary
	state changes. Thus, it is possible to automatically search through
	modified states to find one that leads to the correct output. We
	have developed an implementation based upon dynamic instrumentation
	to perform this search through program re-execution -- the program
	is executed from the beginning and a predicate's outcome is switched
	to produce the desired change in control flow. To evaluate our approach,
	we tried our technique on several reported bugs for a number of UNIX
	utility programs. Our technique was found to be practical (i.e.,
	acceptable in time taken) and effective (i.e., we were able to automatically
	identify critical predicates). Moreover we show that bidirectional
	dynamic slices of critical predicates capture the faulty code.},
